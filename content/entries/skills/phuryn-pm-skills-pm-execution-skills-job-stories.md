# Job Stories
Create job stories using the 'When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]' format. Generates stories with detailed acceptance criteria focused on user situations and outcomes.

**Use when:** Writing job stories, expressing user situations and motivations, creating JTBD-style backlog items, or focusing on user context rather than roles.

**Arguments:**
- `$PRODUCT`: The product or system name
- `$FEATURE`: The new feature to break into job stories
- `$DESIGN`: Link to design files (Figma, Miro, etc.)
- `$CONTEXT`: User situations or job scenarios

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify user situations** that trigger the need
2. **Define motivations** underlying the user's behavior
3. **Clarify outcomes** the user wants to achieve
4. **Apply JTBD framework:** Focus on the job, not the role
5. **Create acceptance criteria** that validate the outcome is achieved
6. **Use observable, measurable language**
7. **Link to design mockups** or prototypes
8. **Output job stories** with detailed acceptance criteria

## Story Template

**Design:** [Link to design files]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. [Situation is properly recognized]
2. [System enables the desired motivation]
3. [Progress or feedback is visible]
4. [Outcome is achieved efficiently]
5. [Edge cases are handled gracefully]
6. [Integration and notifications work]

## Example Job Story

**Title:** Track Weekly Snack Spending

**Description:** When I'm preparing my weekly allowance for snacks (situation), I want to quickly see how much I've spent so far (motivation), so I can make sure I don't run out of money before the weekend (outcome).

6. Notifications at 80% budget threshold
7. Weekend-Specific Reminder at 90% by Thursday evening
8. Easy Access and Navigation to detailed breakdown

## Output Deliverables

- 6-8 acceptance criteria focused on outcomes
- Stories emphasize user situations and motivations
- Clear links to design and prototypes
